# ERP System
ERP System: s a software solution that integrates and manages core business processes like finance, HR, manufacturing, supply chain, and sales, providing a centralized platform for data and operations across an organization.
As of right now I have zero intentions of developing this software any further than "Inventory Management", "Order Management" and certain parts of "Human Resources Management".  I originally just wanted an invenotry management system that I could use to track Vacuum Tube Guitar Amplifier Builds and Rebuilds as well as Vacuum Tube Radio Restoration parts.  I wanted to host it on an Rpi connected to my home network, proxied outward as well.

# React & PostGreSQL
Yep, I'm using React.  I am new to PostGresql.  It's already jacked my Mac once.
